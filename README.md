PyThermal
=========

Generate a thermal image off a given temperature array.

- Edit thermal_config.py according to your requirements.
- Provide data array generated by your source (i.e. Arduino) in CSV format or run:
  - python thermal_dummy_data_generator.py
- Finally run:
  - python thermal_image_generator.py 

Note 1: If the data in the CSV file does not match the thermal_config.py things will go south.

Note 2: All these worlds are yours except Europa. Attempt no landings there.
